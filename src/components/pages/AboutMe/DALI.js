                <p>I think working in DALI would be a great opportunity for me to further 
                        my development skills and apply them to build interesting and rewarding 
                        projects in a group setting. Seeing all of the amazing projects during 
                        Technigala during the Fall and Winter terms made me even more excited 
                        to apply for DALI this term. I look forward to not only getting valuable 
                        work experience as a software engineer, but also being able to work with 
                        and learn from skilled peers and mentors.</p>
